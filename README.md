# **DnD5e Discord Bot**

Playing around with Discord Bots and API calls. 

## Currently Implemented
- *!roll* : Simple Dice Roller 
- *!spell* : Spell Lookup

**All commands bound to the '!' character*

### **Dice Roller** *!roll*

### **Spell Lookup** *!spell*
Very rough, currently only basic exception handling with requiring exact spelling. Plans to add a system to suggest similar/close spells to what was typed.
